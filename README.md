Two modifications of the zmq_rcon.py script that comes with the Quake Live dedicated server:

ql_rcon.py - outputs to a curses window with terminal colour support
irc_rcon.py - outputs to stdout but with mIRC colour codes, e.g. for use with 'eval' in irssi

Both scripts significantly clean up the output vs the base version
